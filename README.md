# Preamble
The end customer would like an online booking system for range of Movie making courses. Their most
popular product this December is Moving Castle Creations – a 3D animation workshop. The system
must take details of customer map them to the course modules along with a single box for extra ‘nice
to have’ requests. The system should be clean and simple. Your team has been tasked with creating
the pipeline for the SDLC. You have also been asked to provide a simple prototype page(s) to test the
pipeline. The system needsto take into account the usual security requirements. The administrator of
the end system (Studio Ghibli member) should be able to access detailed information and edit as
appropriate. Once the client enters details it should not be able to be changed by the person applying
for the course.

Our product will be delivered using an Agile methodology that embraces the DevOps culture. Please note that our culture embraces change and these documents are treated as living, breathing artefacts that will be continuously updated.  The scrum master and product owner will be assigned in a rotation basis per each sprint.

# Branching Strategy
    Our branching stategy will start with :

    2. development -> here feature-branch will be merged with development branch post testing and moving jira task to done
    3. master -> for production
    4. documentation-branch -> any documents/ research/ step-by-step procedure documents will be uploaded here

# Estimating Story Points and Velocity
The teams team's velocity will evetually increase as per sprints. 1 is minimum point and 8 is maximum. Any points that go beyond 8 hours will be considered as Epic.

Velocity:
For Sprint 1 and 2 -> 1 SP= 1 hour, 
For Sprint 3 to 7 -> 1 SP= 2 hour

# Definition of Ready/Done
Will be mentioned in the accepted criteria of each task posted in Jira
