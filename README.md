# Studio-Ghibli

# problem we are solving is as follows 

The end customer would like an online booking system for range of Movie making courses. Their most
popular product this December is Moving Castle Creations – a 3D animation workshop. The system
must take details of customer map them to the course modules along with a single box for extra ‘nice
to have’ requests. The system should be clean and simple. Your team has been tasked with creating
the pipeline for the SDLC. You have also been asked to provide a simple prototype page(s) to test the
pipeline. The system needsto take into account the usual security requirements. The administrator of
the end system (Studio Ghibli member) should be able to access detailed information and edit as
appropriate. Once the client enters details it should not be able to be changed by the person applying
for the course

# Basic Roadmap is added to the documenation branch
